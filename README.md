work-day-3

#Description 
This work day planner was created to allow individuals to schedule throughout their day. It runs from 9-5. There is one row for each one hour time block. Each row has three columns. The first displays the hour, the second allows for text input by the user, and the third is a save button.

Moment.js and JQUERY were used. A function was used to display the current date and time. The function, timeBlock, was used to dynamically create the row and three columns. An if statement was used to keep the time in am/pm by subtracting 12 if the number was greater than 12. The getHours function, along with the for loop, was used to create 9 individual rows with columns.

The local storage and past, present, future color changes still do not work.
